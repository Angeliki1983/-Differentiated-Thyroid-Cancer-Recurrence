# Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction

Welcome to my project on Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction! This repository showcases my exploration and analysis of a dataset aimed at predicting the recurrence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

## Project Overview

This project is a part of my journey to enhance my skills in Python and data analysis. Using a dataset collected over 15 years and featuring 13 clinicopathologic attributes, my goal is to practice and deepen my understanding of data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### Learning Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Gain hands-on experience with data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas.
- **Feature Analysis:** Develop skills in evaluating and interpreting the significance of various features.
- **Model Building:** Experiment with different machine learning models and learn about model evaluation and improvement.
- **Visualization:** Create and refine visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
- **Documentation:** Improve my ability to document and present my analysis process and findings.

### Skills Development

- Building proficiency in Python for data analysis, particularly with pandas.
- Learning to apply machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance. (Complete beginner here!)
- Developing the ability to work with medical data and derive actionable insights.
- Enhancing skills in data visualization to present complex information clearly.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/915/differentiated+thyroid+cancer+recurrence). It includes 13 clinicopathologic features related to thyroid cancer recurrence.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-recurrence.git`

2. **Explore the Data:** Begin by examining the data in the provided Jupyter notebooks.
3. **Run Analysis:** Follow the notebooks to perform data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
