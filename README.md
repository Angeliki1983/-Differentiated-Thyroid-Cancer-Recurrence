# Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction

Hey there! Check out my project on Predicting Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence. This repository shows how I dug into and broke down a dataset to predict if well-differentiated thyroid cancer might come back. 

## Project Overview

This project is a part of my journey to enhance my skills in Python and data analysis. Using a dataset collected over 15 years and featuring 13 clinicopathologic attributes, my goal is to practice and deepen my understanding of data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### Learning Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Get hands-on practice to clean and preprocess data using pandas.
- **Feature Analysis:**  Learn to evaluate and interpret how important different features are. 
- **Model Building:** Try out various machine learning models and understand how to assess and enhance them.
- **Visualization:** Make and improve visuals to share insights .
- **Documentation:** Get better at writing up and showing my analysis steps and results.

### Skills Development

- Improve my Python skills for data analysis with pandas.
- Figure out how to use machine learning algorithms and check how well they work.(I'm new to all this!)
- Developing the ability to work with medical data and derive actionable insights.
- Get better at making data visuals to show complex info . 

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/915/differentiated+thyroid+cancer+recurrence). It includes 13 clinicopathologic features related to thyroid cancer recurrence.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-recurrence.git`

2. **Explore the Data:** Begin by examining the data in the provided Jupyter notebooks.
3. **Run Analysis:** Follow the notebooks to perform data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
